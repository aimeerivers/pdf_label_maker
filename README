PdfLabelMaker
=============

Generates PDFs that can print to Avery labels.

Requires pdf-writer (gem install pdf-writer).


Example
=======

Get a collection of contacts and send them to the label maker, with the Avery code of the size labels. For example:

  class ContactsController < ApplicationController

    def index
      @contacts = Contact.all.ordered
      respond_to do |format|
        format.pdf do
          pdf = PdfLabelMaker.avery_labels(@contacts)
          send_data pdf.render, :filename => 'labels.pdf', :type => 'application/pdf'
        end
        format.html
      end
    end
    
  end

This would be found at /contacts.pdf

Your model needs to implement a 'label_lines' method which returns an array - one element for each line to appear on the label.

  class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    def label_lines
      returning Array.new do |arr|
        arr << full_name
        address.split("\r\n").each{|line| arr << line}
      end
    end

  end


Options
=======

Send the label code that you want printed. Default is 'L7162' which is 16 labels per page.

  pdf = PdfLabelMaker.avery_labels(@contacts, 'J8651')

This would print the J8651 format, which is 65 little labels per page.

Not all label formats are supported yet, but you could send your own if necessary. Just send a bunch of options, like this:

  class ContactsController < ApplicationController

    require 'pdf/writer'
    include PDF
      
    def index
      @contacts = Contact.all.ordered
      respond_to do |format|
        format.pdf do
          options = {
            :columns => 3,
            :labels_per_page => 30,
            :left_margin => Writer.mm2pts(4),
            :bottom_margin => Writer.mm2pts(25),
            :label_width => Writer.mm2pts(67),
            :label_height => Writer.mm2pts(26.3),
            :label_padding_x => Writer.mm2pts(4),
            :label_padding_y => Writer.mm2pts(3),
            :gap_between_labels_x => Writer.mm2pts(4),
            :font_size =>  9,
            :line_height =>  10
          }
          pdf = PdfLabelMaker.avery_labels(@contacts, 'user-defined', options)
          send_data pdf.render, :filename => 'labels.pdf', :type => 'application/pdf'
        end
        format.html
      end
    end
    
  end


You can also override any of the settings, just like this:

  pdf = PdfLabelMaker.avery_labels(@contacts, 'L7162', {:font_size => 20, :font => 'Times-Roman'})
